### Overview

For this project, the prompt was to analyze Reddit posts to see which keywords make them go viral. I had been "hired" by FiveThirtyEight to recommend how they could increase the virality of their posts. My recommendation was that viral posts on Reddit are always entertainment-related, and since FiveThirtyEight is a news website, they should either pick a more relevant website to analyze, or, if they desire, try to break into the entertainment news space.

### Motivation

This project leaned much more on Data Science and Machine Learning techniques than my previous projects. It made use of both web scraping and natural language processing, as well as some more advanced modeling techniques: Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression.

This was the third project from my Data Science Immersive Bootcamp at General Assembly.

### Data

Data was scraped from Reddit.com using Requests from the url lib package and Beautiful Soup for parsing the data.
